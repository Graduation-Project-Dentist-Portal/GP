DentalHub is a platform that connects dental students, dentists, and patients all together.

It provides many services for them, especially for dental students.

Our goal is to help each one of them.

For dental students, we connect them with patients to work on them to pass their tests.

and we provide them with a database that they can insert cases into for other students.

and each dental student can have a portfolio that they can add their finished cases to, and it works like a CV when they want to work.

and we provide them with a page where they can sell, buy, or trade tools.

and we also provide them with a page where they can find jobs and trainings, as well as for dentists to post an open job or position.

For patients, we provide them with a place where they can describe what they feel, and we connect them with a dental student to help them.
